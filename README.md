Assignment 2: Understanding Control Structures in C++ Programming
COP 2006: Programming I

Objectives
  The goal of this assignment is to reinforce your understanding of control structures in C++
  programming and their application in solving problems. By completing this assignment, you will
  gain hands-on experience with conditional statements, loops, and branching constructs, which are
  fundamental elements in the development of algorithms and programs.
Program Descriptions
  Develop a simple calculator program in C++ that allows users to perform basic arithmetic
  operations (i.e., addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. If your
  program needs to incorporate multiple conditions for a more refined the calculation you can use
  using logical operators (&&, ||).
Requirements:
  • User Input
    o The program should prompt the user to enter two integer numbers.
    o The user should be prompted to choose an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /).
  • If-Else Control Structures
    o Implement the core logic of the calculator using if-else/nested if-else statements to
      determine the selected operation and calculate the result accordingly.
    o Handle the case of division by zero and display an error message if necessary.
    o If the entered operation is not one of the specified options, display an error message.
  • Switch Control Structures
    o Reset the result and implement the same calculator logic using a switch statement.
    o Ensure that the switch statement covers all possible arithmetic operations.
    o Handle the case of division by zero and display an error message if necessary.
    o If the entered operation is not one of the specified options, display an error message.
  • While-loop Control Structures
    o Reset the result and reimplement the same calculator program by implementing the
      logic either using a switch statement or if-else/nested if-else statement.
    o The while loop will be implemented by using sentinel-controlled while loop which
      continues until the user explicitly chooses to exit by pressing 'E' or 'e'.
    o After each set of calculations, the program prompts the user with the question "Do
      you want to perform another calculation? (Press 'E' to exit, any other key to
      continue):" and reads the user's choice into variable, for example, continueChoice.
    o If the user presses 'E' or 'e', the program prints a farewell message and exits the
      while loop.
    o If the user enters any other key, the loop continues with the next iteration, allowing
      the user to perform additional calculations.
